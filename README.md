Hi there! Clarence here! This is the submission to Airwallex for the assignment!

In this project, we are doing a Dog Breed Quiz to test your knowledge on how well you know about Dogs!
These are the rules set out for this Quiz

- For every correct answer, you will get 1 point
- At the end of the quiz, you will receive your final score and you may try out again with a different group of dogs
- At any point in time, you may choose to reset the quiz by clicking the top right corner button
